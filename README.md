# CVE_Linux_kernel_classifier
Created by: Mitchel Aloserij

This application is created to support my findings during literature study research.
This application extracts the useful CVE information from various JSON data feeds, offered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Then based on the data it collected it will filter out only the CVEs that are relevant for the Linux kernel. Next, it will classify the remainder of CVEs based on their type of vulnerability. 
Then, lastly, it will create multiple graphical displays that have been used within my literature study paper.
